# Personal-Port-Folio
This personal portfolio website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend and SpringBoot for backend highlighting my fullstack web development skills. It includes sections for my resume, About myself, my Skills and my contact information, with a focus on a user-friendly and interactive design. It also contains a form, which is linked with sql via Springboot in the backend and file handling has also been done in order to maintain a good interaction with myself and the clients/employers. This site emphasizes interactivity and a seamless browsing experience.
